================================
SWOT Simulator for Ocean Science
================================

Description
-----------
This software simulates SWOT sea surface height (SSH) observations that can be applied to an ocean general circulation model (OGCM), allowing the exploration of ideas and methods to optimize information retrieval from the SWOT Mission in the future. From OGCM SSH inputs, the software samples SWOT-like outputs on a swath along the orbit ground track and adds measurement error and noise, which are generated according to technical characteristics published by the SWOT project team.
The simulator can also be used to simulate nadir-like data for any altimeters.

The swotsimulator code can be downloaded at http://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/science/resources/

Licence
-------
The swotsimulator is under LGPL licence (see :ref:`COPYING <licence_long>` )

Installation
------------
The code runs with python and uses the following libraries: 

* Numpy 

* Scipy

* NetCDF4 if you need to read netcdf4 model files (not included in Canopy)

If you don't have python and the needed python libraries on your machine 
you can download the enthought python distribution canopy at
<https://store.enthought.com/> and follow the installation instructions.

To install swotsimulator: 

-> If you have installed canopy:

Open a canopy terminal (``Tools - Canopy Terminal``) 

.. code-block:: python

   > cd [yourpath]/swotsimulator/
   > python setup.py install 

->If you have your own python and libraries:

- global installation (requires root privilege):

.. code-block:: python

   > sudo python setup.py install 

- local installation:

.. code-block:: python

   > python setup.py install --home=your/local/path 

- Uninstall: 

.. code-block:: python

   > sudo python setup.py install --record record_files.txt
   > cat record_files.txt | xargs sudo rm -rf

Running
--------
Run the SWOT simulator:

.. code-block:: python

   > python run.py [your params file]

Run the nadir alone:

.. code-block:: python

   > python run_nadiralone.py [your params file]


For example, to run the example do:

* open ``./example/params_example.txt`` and check that the directory path
  are correct, if needed modify path of ``dir_setup``, ``indatadir``, ``outdatadir``
  with your own path (the path of the simulator directory).

* Run the simulator:
  ``python run.py ./example/params_example.txt``


Note that if you have installed python using enthought Canopy, you should either
use the Canopy terminal or run the canopy python instead of python (direct path or
use an alias). 

The data provided in the example were produced by the Regional Ocean Modeling System 
(ROMS) off the Oregon coast developed by Dr. Yi Chao and his team.

Testing
-------
Outputs of the simulator can be tested using algorithm from the test directory. 

To run all tests, go to the test directory: 

.. code-block:: python

  > python run_all.py [your params file]

Documentation
-------------
- To build the documentation, in the ``doc`` directory:
  
    * Build html: ``make html``

    * Build pdf: ``make latexpdf``

  The build documentation files are located in ``doc/build/html`` and in ``doc/build/latex/`` 

- for a complete description:
  see the ``doc`` directory or just run ``pydoc PyDom``

  .. doc: doc/html/index.html
